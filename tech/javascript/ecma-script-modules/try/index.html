  <h1>ESM test</h1>
  <p>Most simple test - imports constant a and prints its value in console.</p>
  <p>Open the console to see that import is working in the browser.</p>
  <h2>Check network requests</h2>
  <p>
    Every imported file becomes a separate network request.
    From one side we have automatic lazy loading because we don't have to
    split our bundle with some webpack loadable plugins.
    But from the other hand we would still need to at list minify our files
    for production and we wouldn't want every single file to be 'lazy-loaded'
    we would want to combine some part of the logic together in one bundle.
    So it turns out webpack is still needed even if we don't care about
    older browsers support.
