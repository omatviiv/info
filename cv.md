# Work experience
### Agility (USS): (09.2019 - till now)
Leading UI development for all Shipa projects:

- Led and initiated the development of a company-specific shared UI
components library, which is reused in all of the company's projects. This
component library shares the same responsive designs and ensures
accessibility across all company projects. However, the main highlight of
this UI library solution is its style-agnostic components development
approach, which I am continuously working to improve outside of working
hours. You can find more information about this approach here:
https://github.com/omatviiv/styleagnostic-input#style-agnostic-component-approach.

- Led development of two customer-facing portals focused on SEO and performance,
one using NextJS and another using Gatsby. Both portals offer high flexibility
in configuration through a CMS.

- Created two customer-facing complex web applications with custom
authentication solutions, separation of concerns, lazy loading, and
a node facade proxy (and more than just a proxy) server.

- Rewrote an internal staff dashboard with custom authentication,
separation of concerns, lazy loading, and a facade node server.

- Worked on a UI project for a custom IdentityServer4-based authorization
provider solution. This project supports completely different UI designs
for various authentication clients, including sign-in, sign-up, sign-out,
forgot password, and other authentication pages. Almost all dashboard
applications utilize this authorization solution, each with different styling.

- Developed several UI seed template projects for quickly starting
development on new applications. These projects are built using a custom
TypeScript/Webpack setup.

- Created the redux-slice library, a small but powerful library inspired by
Redux Toolkit. We could not use Redux Toolkit because its not flexible enough
to support our separation of concerns approach. This library provides a raw
Redux-based solution that supports the separation of concerns approach for
business logic and significantly reduces boilerplate code, simplifying
client-side state management in general. This library greatly facilitates
the separation of concerns approach that I led the development of,
providing a Redux-based approach that effectively separates business logic
from visual presentation and allows for lazy loading of business logic.

- Developed the auth-sdk library, which is based on openid-client. This
library enables the usage of different authentication providers for any
client application that requires OAuth 2.0 openid-compliant authorization.
Currently, some applications use our custom IdentityServer4 authentication
provider, while others use MS Active Directory.

- Contributed to several other auxiliary small projects.
