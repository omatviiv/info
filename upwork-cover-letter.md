Hi,

I've got big commercial experience with creating react applications for
multiple companies, took part or was leading multiple successful
applications development for different companies from different parts of
the world including USA. Also have a decent amount of experience in node
based ui supporting applications including development of custom
authorisation solutions to secure ui. My current full time project is
comprehensive solution for logistic company from UAE. My latest experience
with USA based company was internal reporting system development for
California based company Twilio where I took part from the very beginning
and up to release of the project.

# Components library approach
To be more specific I designed comprehensive solution and currently
continue to lead web development in UAE based logistic company. I've
developed effective approach to build reusable components library that are
reusable across react applications with completely different styling.
Currently I started development of the open source version of the improved
approach on my public github account. Currently its only at "top of the
iceberg" stage but you can have a look and I believe main principles are
already understandable from the template project I've published for a
styleagnostic component https://github.com/omatviiv/styleagnostic-component.
Currently this components approach is implemented for the mentioned company
and multiple customer facing and internal project are successfully using it.

# Custom auth with node supporting ui application.
I've developed openid auth sdk that allows to reuse same authorisation
approach across multiple company projects and with multiple auth providers
(Active Directory, open source IdentityServer4) to provide Oauth 2.0
compliant approach to signin users. And to provide most secure Code grant
Oauth 2.0 flow node service is being used to provide secure api calls and
serve ui react applications.

# Custom redux approach
Developed a library to greatly reduce boilerplate code of the standard
redux implementation and to allow redux modules lazy loading which is
helpful for big applications where webpack code spliting is in use because
it allows to code split not just the react ui parts but also do the same
with redux logic.

# Test driven development
I do myself and highly encourage every team member to follow test driven
development approach with pure functions. I sounds simple - write failing
tests first and then throughout the target function implementation slowly
fix all the cases in the function test plan but in practice for developers
its easier said than done and most of the people really struggling to
switch to TDD because it requires changing developer approach to solving
problem.

# Separation of concerns
With the help of redux middleware based solution and TDD approach achieved
effective business logic separation which makes ui and logic part much more
stable and easier to upgrade or maintain.

Attaching my concise CV. I didn't need to work over Upwork in the past as
you would be able to see but I believe this shouldn't be any kind of an
issue in the end Upwork is just a platform.
