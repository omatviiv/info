1. [The Manager's Path](https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B06XP3GJ7F&ref_=dbs_t_r_khbodl)
A book for people management in tech teams. A book with practical timps that
you can get back to over time when facing specific challenges.
2. [First, Break All the Rules]
Recommended book by author of source#1 but as a book for management people in
general, not specifically for tech teams.



# Leading tech teams recomendations
- Don't try to manage tech team without prior hands-on experience (source#1).

# 1-on-1s
Good 1-on-1 serves two purposes:
1. Create human connection.
For example knowing about some challenges in personal life of your team member
will make it easier to ask for time off in case of unexpected events
(childbirth, relatives death, ...).
2. Share some information privately to the manager. Maybe some unhapiness with
task or team member or some personal issue.

It is ok to have 1-on-1s every two weeks or mor as long as its not too frequent
but regularly enough to plan for some discussions or raising something personal.
Sometimes 1-on-1s can be skipped if there is nothing to discuss or infrormation
can be shared over email or chat.

# Training and carrier growth
Manger shouod help understand in which direction to grow, provide some
books or conferences recommendations. Manager should be aware of compensation
increase buerocracy and help with it.

**Mentoring** - interns or new tema member should be assigned to a mentor.
Who guies them through the first weeks, helps to understand the codebase,
and answer questions.



# Good manager
- **measure** - what you measure, you improve. Every goal has to be measurable.
Otherwise its hard to track progress. So its crucial to have clear focused
measurable goals.
- **communication** - both spoken and written.
- **presenting** - ability to lead presentations confidently.
- **prioritizing** - ability to prioritize tasks and goals.
- **veto** - ability to hold on or change priorities.
For example, if you see something is going wrong direction and needs different
approach its better to do it right from the beginning rather than refactor later.
- **delectate** - ability to delegate tasks rather than micromanage. Its easier
for us to do what we can do best, write code for example. Being a tech lead
means you have to balance your time and delegate tasks to other team members.
Rather than trying to do everything yourself.
- **project management** - ability to break down tasks into smaller.
Understand business requirements and translate them into technical tasks.
- **exmplain** - always take a time to expalin well some even basic trivial
for you ideas because people may not understand and feel uncomfortable to ask
publicly its true about both developers and managers.

# Bad manager
**Alpha geek** - a person who has deep knowledge about the system but also
very jealous about it so that he/she doesn't respect other people who's
knowledge is not as deep as his/her. Newer allow such a person to become
a manager because he/she can hide some information to keep the power and
can intimidate other people.
