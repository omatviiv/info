# Good manager (tech lead)
## Soft skills
- **measure** - what you measure, you improve. Every goal has to be measurable.
Otherwise its hard to track progress. So its crucial to have clear focused
measurable goals.
- **communication and listening** - both spoken and written. Your
productivity as a tech lead is less important that productivity of the team
so you need to communicate well to ensure everyone understands what to do
and why. Ability to really hear what people in the team are saying.
- **presenting** - ability to lead presentations confidently.
- **prioritizing** - ability to prioritize tasks and goals.
- **veto** - ability to hold on or change priorities.
For example, if you see something is going wrong direction and needs different
approach its better to do it right from the beginning rather than refactor later.
- **delectate** - ability to delegate tasks rather than micromanage. Its easier
for us to do what we can do best, write code for example. Being a tech lead
means you have to balance your time and delegate tasks to other team members.
Rather than trying to do everything yourself.
- **project management** - ability to break down tasks into smaller.
Understand business requirements and translate them into technical tasks.
Understand which tasks can be done in parallel and which in sequence.
Break down writing project into pieces then those pieces into smaller pieces
and so on. If you don't understand some area then involve tema member who does.
Once it is broken down into small enough pieces start ordering.
- **exmplain** - always take a time to expalin well some even basic trivial
for you ideas because people may not understand and feel uncomfortable to ask
publicly its true about both developers and managers.
- **Conflict tamer** - a manager who is not avoiding hard conversations.
If part of a team has to pause work on something and help the other on
something that is more important at the moment then its better to explain
on 1-on-1s why this is happenging and make that decision clear to everyone.
If the team doesn't agree on some tech decisions then gather options from
all sides get information about pros and cons and make a decision.


## Hard skills
- **technical knowledge** - you can't be a good tech lead if you don't have
enought knowledge or you don't understand system architecture.
- **lead technical decisions** - you can't control everything but you need
to participate in technical decisions and be aware of them.




# Bad manager (tech lead)
- **Alpha geek** - a person who has deep knowledge about the system but also
very jealous about it so that he/she doesn't respect other people who's
knowledge is not as deep as his/her. Newer allow such a person to become
a manager because he/she can hide some information to keep the power and
can intimidate other people.
- **Office czar** - a person who is very good at office politics and following
processes. What is bad about such another extreme is that these people often
are focusing on something easily measurable like hours in the office or
number of meetings and lack flexibility and understanding that in reality
not everything can be well structured and unexpected things happen.
Good engineers somethimes become office czars when promoted to tech leads.
They start to look for a tool which will solve all problems, or constantly
pushing for new tools in seek for perfection.
Agile manifesto principles:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
Rather than being processes cop try to automate processes where possible.
- **Micromanager** - a person who doesn't trust team members and wants to
control every step every tech decision. But the thing is that sometimes
you need to micromanage junior members its a matter of whether
micromanagement is your habit and you trust nobody or do it when needed.
Talented engeeniers tend to become micromanagers when promoted to tech
leads especially if they pride themselves on their technical skills.
I personally think that balance between micromanagement and delegation
should be achieved via effective code splitting and code reviews.
Practicing separation of concerns architecture, pure comonents development
will definitely help to delegate more reliably.
It is much more important for you to focus on some bigger more important
problems then trying to find minor errors in code of your team members.
- **Conflict avoider** - a manager that can't say no and always avoids
hard decisions by proposing an unfair vote just to get rid of responsibility.
Such manager can't decline new projects for the team because of hight load
or ask higher management for more people. Such situation leads to burnout.
This is not good conflict handling, the opposite will be **conflict tamer**.




# Responsibilities of a manager (tech lead)
## Training and carrier growth
Manger shouod help understand in which direction to grow, provide some
books or conferences recommendations. Manager should be aware of compensation
increase buerocracy and help with it.

**Mentoring** - interns or new tema member should be assigned to a mentor.
Who guides them through the first weeks, helps to understand the codebase,
and answers questions.


## Regular 1-on-1s
Its recomended to do it weekly and adjust frequency along the way.
It is ok to have 1-on-1s every two weeks or more as long as its not too frequent
but regularly enough to plan for some discussions or raising something personal.
Sometimes 1-on-1s can be skipped if there is nothing to discuss or infrormation
can be shared over email or chat.
Its best to plan 1-on-1s in the morning and ont on Mondays or Fridays.
If you interact with somebody very often then there may be no need to
have 1-on-1s that often. Junior member may need more 1-on-1s than senior.
Company news can be discussed on 1-on-1s as well.

Good 1-on-1 serves two purposes:
1. Create human connection.
For example knowing about some challenges in personal life of your team member
will make it easier to ask for time off in case of unexpected events
(childbirth, relatives death, ...).
2. Share some information privately to the manager. Maybe some unhapiness with
task or team member or some personal issue.

**privacy** - these meetings should always be private so that tema member
can share some sensitive info.

**1-on-1s styles**
- **To Do list meeting**: every side has a plan to go through and this can
be done quickly without wasting time. Both sides can share the list
so taht they are prepared for 1-on-1 and save even more time.
-  **Catch-up**: not very organized way but the goal here is to listen
to what team member has to say. This kind of meeting gives more freedom
for team meber. The down side is that it can became a complain session
and manager should not allow relations to become too close.
- **Feedback**: if you have a team member that has problems with
performance then you can use 1-on-1s to give feedback and discuss
improvements.
- **Getting to knonw**: let a team member talk about himself/herself
some personal stuff but not too much.
- **Mix it up**: mix different styles to keep it fresh, it can even
be done as a walking meeting or when having a coffee.

**Take notes** - accumulate notes for each team member because things
can be forgotten easily.


## Conflict managememnt
As already mentioned in Godd/Bad manager sections for Conflict avoider
and Conflict tamer there are other recomendations thought:
- don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Not all team members
are equal in project knowledge and experience their votes are not eaqual.
- do a clear processes to depersonalize decisions.
- donn't turn a blind eye to simmering issues. If the problem is ignored
for way too long. If you didn't see the problem in the team and only
notice it from serveral other people's feedback - thats not a good sign.
- do address issues without courting drama. Ask yourself: is this an
ongoing problem? Is this something you have personally noticed? Is this
something many team members are struggling with? The goal is to resolve
issues which are really affecting team performance, not to become a team
therapist.
- be kind, say please and thank you.
- don't be afrraid, don't avoid conflict because of feat of confrontation.

**Team Cohesion Destroyers** - its very good if the team is friendly
sharing lunches and having some coffee chats. This friendliness leads to
psychological safety when people feel safe to take risks and admit mistakes
in front of each other. Ask about some lightweight personal stuff: how
are their kids, how was the weekend or vacation. So toxic people who
destroy this team cohesion are bad for the team. Few types of such destroyers:
- Brilliant jerk - a person who is very smart and productive but rude
to other less smart people. Tak with such person in private and explain
what har is happening.
- Noncommunicator - such person is not collaborative with the team.
- Person without respect - a person who doesn't have respect for a manager
or other team members. It will be hard to resolve this issue, you may
need help of your manager.


## Performance reviews
Its not required to wait until performance review to give feedback, better
to share positive feedback or corrective feedback as soon as possible.
Its good to share feedback when coaching.
Steps to be great at continuous feedback:
1. Know your people. What are their goals, strengths, weaknesses.
2. Observe your people. You can't give feedbakc if you aren't observing.
3. Provide lightweight, regular feedback. Start with positive feedback.
It allows to get better attention for corrective feedback that will follow.

**360 model** - once a year more formal review with self-evaluation from
each team member is required. Try to sit and review each peson's full year
what has happened with that person, what has changed, what has been achieved.
It will be easier if you had 1-on-1s notes. Focus on achievements.
As for areas for imporvements: few examples of issues some persons fase:
- can't say no and spend too much time helping others than working on their
own tasks.
- does good work but hard to work with others, is rude on meetings and in
code reviews
- struggles to break work into smaller pieces
- works well with teammates but doesn't work well with other departments
- struggles to follow teams best practices


## Firing people
If somebody is underperforming there are most porbably some HR processes
for this situation and for such persons Performance Improvements Plan (PIP)
is required - if persons achieves the goals in fixed period of thime then
all is good if not then person should be fired.
But such a plan is the last step. You should avoid surprises especially bad
ones and tell the person what is bad and what needs to be improved as soon
as possible when you notice something wrong.




# Starting as a new manager

## 30/60/90 days plan
Create 30/60/90 days plan together with team. Like getting up to speed
with the project, performing a release.
