1. [The Manager's Path](https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B06XP3GJ7F&ref_=dbs_t_r_khbodl)
A book for people management in tech teams. A book with practical timps that
you can get back to over time when facing specific challenges.
2. [First, Break All the Rules]
Recommended book by author of source#1 but as a book for management people in
general, not specifically for tech teams.




# 1-on-1s
Good 1-on-1 serves two purposes:
1. Create human connection.
For example knowing about some challenges in personal life of your team member
will make it easier to ask for time off in case of unexpected events
(childbirth, relatives death, ...).
2. Share some information privately to the manager. Maybe some unhapiness with
task or team member or some personal issue.

It is ok to have 1-on-1s every two weeks or mor as long as its not too frequent
but regularly enough to plan for some discussions or raising something personal.
Sometimes 1-on-1s can be skipped if there is nothing to discuss or infrormation
can be shared over email or chat.




# Training and carrier growth
Manger shouod help understand in which direction to grow, provide some
books or conferences recommendations. Manager should be aware of compensation
increase buerocracy and help with it.

**Mentoring** - interns or new tema member should be assigned to a mentor.
Who guies them through the first weeks, helps to understand the codebase,
and answer questions.




# Good manager (tech lead)
## Soft skills
- **measure** - what you measure, you improve. Every goal has to be measurable.
Otherwise its hard to track progress. So its crucial to have clear focused
measurable goals.
- **communication and listening** - both spoken and written. Your
productivity as a tech lead is less important that productivity of the team
so you need to communicate well to ensure everyone understands what to do
and why. Ability to really hear what people in the team are saying.
- **presenting** - ability to lead presentations confidently.
- **prioritizing** - ability to prioritize tasks and goals.
- **veto** - ability to hold on or change priorities.
For example, if you see something is going wrong direction and needs different
approach its better to do it right from the beginning rather than refactor later.
- **delectate** - ability to delegate tasks rather than micromanage. Its easier
for us to do what we can do best, write code for example. Being a tech lead
means you have to balance your time and delegate tasks to other team members.
Rather than trying to do everything yourself.
- **project management** - ability to break down tasks into smaller.
Understand business requirements and translate them into technical tasks.
Understand which tasks can be done in parallel and which in sequence.
Break down writing project into pieces then those pieces into smaller pieces
and so on. If you don't understand some area then involve tema member who does.
Once it is broken down into small enough pieces start ordering.
- **exmplain** - always take a time to expalin well some even basic trivial
for you ideas because people may not understand and feel uncomfortable to ask
publicly its true about both developers and managers.

## Hard skills
- **technical knowledge** - you can't be a good tech lead if you don't have
enought knowledge or you don't understand system architecture.
- **lead technical decisions** - you can't control everything but you need
to participate in technical decisions and be aware of them.




# Bad manager (tech lead)
- **Alpha geek** - a person who has deep knowledge about the system but also
very jealous about it so that he/she doesn't respect other people who's
knowledge is not as deep as his/her. Newer allow such a person to become
a manager because he/she can hide some information to keep the power and
can intimidate other people.
- **Office czar** - a person who is very good at office politics and following
processes. What is bad about such another extreme is that these people often
are focusing on something easily measurable like hours in the office or
number of meetings and lack flexibility and understanding that in reality
not everything can be well structured and unexpected things happen.
Good engineers somethimes become office czars when promoted to tech leads.
They start to look for a tool which will solve all problems, or constantly
pushing for new tools in seek for perfection.
Agile manifesto principles:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
Rather than being processes cop try to automate processes where possible.




# Starting as a new manager
# Questions to each tema member
When start as a manager of new team you need to know every team member.
Questions that you can ask to each team member on first 1-on-1:
- How do you like to be praised? Publicly or privately?
Some peole hate to be praised publicly.
- What is your preferred way of communicating for serious feedback?
Written or verbal communication?
- Why did you decide to work here?
- How do I know when you are in bad mood or you are annoyed?
- Are there manager behaviors that you hate?
- Do you have career goals that I can help you with?
- Any surprises shohuld I know about since you joined?
I was promised that I will be working with React but its mostly Angular.
I was promised relocation bonus but it never came.


## 30/60/90 days plan
Create 30/60/90 days plan together with team. Like getting up to speed
with the project, performing a release.


## Onboarding documents
Create onboarding documents and update them with every new team member.
New hire has clear view on established processes and may see something
that nobody else noticed.


## Regular 1-on-1s
Its recomended to do it weekly and adjust frequency along the way.
Its best to plan 1-on-1s in the morning and ont on Mondays or Fridays.
If you interact with somebody very often then there may be no need to
have 1-on-1s that often. Junior member may need more 1-on-1s than senior.
Company news can be discussed on 1-on-1s as well.

**privacy** - these meetings should always be private so that tema member
can share some sensitive info.

**1-on-1s styles**
- **To Do list meeting**: every side has a plan to go through and this can
be done quickly without wasting time. Both sides can share the list
so taht they are prepared for 1-on-1 and save even more time.
-  **Catch-up**: not very organized way but the goal here is to listen
to what team member has to say. This kind of meeting gives more freedom
for team meber. The down side is that it can became a complain session
and manager should not allow relations to become too close.
- **Feedback**: if you have a team member that has problems with
performance then you can use 1-on-1s to give feedback and discuss
improvements.
- **Getting to knonw**: let a team member talk about himself/herself
some personal stuff but not too much.
- **Mix it up**: mix different styles to keep it fresh, it can even
be done as a walking meeting or when having a coffee.

**Take notes** - accumulate notes for each team member because things
can be forgotten easily.
